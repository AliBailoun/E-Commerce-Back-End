# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description:
Hello there... (General Kenobi?) and welcome to my Object Relational Mapping E-Commerce Back-end project. This whole thing was made in order to streamline the process of working with information data and sorting that data out in a functional manner that allowsthe website to compete with other E-Commerce websites.

## How to use:
Clone down the repo and run the commands npm run seed followed by npm run start (after installing dependencies) and open thunderclient or other service to start working with your data.
